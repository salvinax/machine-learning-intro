# machine-learning-intro

repo for some of my first machine learning projects using python

## Perceptron
Implemented a single layer perceptron neural network using only numpy for emotion classification.
Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/praveengovi/emotions-dataset-for-nlp

## Backpropagation
Implemented a three-layer Neural Network that updates weights with backpropagation for handwritten digit recognition (MNIST dataset).

- **Part 1:** only used Pytorch to implement model described above (used this website to understand how to implement backpropagation from scratch: https://mattmazur.com/2015/03/17/a-step-by-step-backpropagation-example/) 

- **Part 2:** used scikit-learn framework 

## Clustering-and-PCA
- Implemented a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) network to extract one sound from an audio file using only numpy.
- Implemented a K-Means clustering algorithm using only numpy. Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parulpandey/palmer-archipelago-antarctica-penguin-data
